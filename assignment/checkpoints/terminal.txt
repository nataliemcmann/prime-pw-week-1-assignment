# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
       git version 2.33.0        
# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
    Running 'git status' allows you to see file status in relation to your 
    local Git branch and online GitHub repository. The terminal displays that 
    your GitHub repository is either up to date or behind the local branch 
    by a number of commits. The terminal also lists what local branch file 
    changes have yet to be committed as well as what file changes are not 
    staged for commit.
# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
   'git add .' saves or stages all modified files in the local branch. This step 
   is a prerequisite to commiting modified files.
# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
    git push origin main
